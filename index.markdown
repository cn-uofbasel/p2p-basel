The aim of the P2P Basel workshop is to bring together researchers and software builders to share insights and collaborate towards the sound and sustainable development of efficient eventually-consistent (offline-first) peer-to-peer systems. Examples of related projects of interest are [Secure-Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/), [DAT/Hypercore](https://docs.holepunch.to/), [Cabal](https://cabal.chat/), [Socket Supply co.](https://socketsupply.co/), [Earthstar](https://earthstar-project.org/), [Willow](https://willowprotocol.org/), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/), [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/), [P2Panda](https://p2panda.org/).

The workshop is intended for 14 participants, 4 from the [Computer Networks Group @ Unibasel](https://cn.dmi.unibas.ch/) and 10 invited external researchers and developers. The workshop is intentionally kept small to encourage deep technical discussions, foster strong collaborations between participants, and make the logistics easier to manage collaboratively.

### -> Invited Tutorials/Lectures (Friday January 26th Morning & Afternoon)

We will have up to 6 introduction tutorials and lectures of ~1h on core topics
of interest:

  1. "Git Internals" by [Ali Ajorian](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/ajorian-ali/) [Ref: [Git Book v2, Git Internals Sections 10.1-10.3](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)]

       ````This will be an interactive session in which you will be invited to follow along by running commands in your terminal.````

  2. "Cryptographic Primitives" by [Osman BiÃ§er](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/bicer-osman/)
  3. "Fundamentals of Reliable Distributed Programming" by [Erick Lavoie](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/lavoie-erick)
  4. "State-based Conflict-Free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs)" by [Erick Lavoie](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/lavoie-erick)
  5. *To be announced*
  6. *To be announced*

These lectures are open to students and researchers of the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Basel. Participants are invited to 
prepare in advance by reading the relevant reference material.


### -> Official Welcome (Saturday January 27th 9h-9h15)

The official opening of the workshop will be done on Saturday morning.


### -> Invited Talks (Saturday January 27th and Sunday January 28th Mornings)

**Format**: Saturday and Sunday mornings will have 15-minutes talks, each followed by a question period of 5 minutes. There are 7 slots reserved on each day, enough for each participant to present. These slots are intended for structured presentations prepared in advance of the event. 

**Purpose**: The invited talks should present new insights that are likely to be useful to other participants in their own projects. These insights might come, for example, from having deeply reflected about fundamental problems, or found unexpected issues in deployments that you wished you had known earlier because they would have led to different design decisions. You are strongly encouraged, but not obliged, to publish those insights in citable academic papers (such as pre-prints on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)) or blog posts on your project's website prior to your talk. If you do so, we will link to them next to your talk. 

The talks are not intended for general marketing of your project: all participants are already fully busy advancing their own project(s) and so they are unlikely to drop theirs to join yours. Marketing towards a general audience will be better served by other venues (blog posts, videos, talks in larger conferences, etc.).

**Diffusion**: You do not need to attend the workshop to see the talks. We will make them available publicly after the event, hopefully on Archive.org as for the 2023 edition (ex: [Sat. Jan. 28th, 2023](https://archive.org/details/p2p-basel-2023-day1), [Sun. Jan. 29th](https://archive.org/details/p2p-basel-2023-day2)).

Current invited talks:
  1. Members of the [Computer Networks Group](https://cn.dmi.unibas.ch/) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel) (4 slots)
  2. To be announced (10 slots)

### -> [Tinguely Museum](https://www.tinguely.ch/en.html) (Sunday January 28th 13h)

## Travel and Accommodations

You will have to organize travel and accommodations yourself. Basel is easily
accessible by train and by plane. The cheapest hosting option is typically
AirBnB.

## Volunteering and Self-Organization

Half of the program will be done in a participant-driven [unconference style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). You can already think about sessions you'd like to host, discussions you'd like to initiate, etc.

To keep registration fees low, we will collectively cook and clean for ourselves during the event. All participants are expected to contribute: aprons and kitchenware are provided. Meals will be organized so that they do not require more than 30-60 minutes of preparation/cleaning from volunteers during the meal breaks, and will cook (if needed) in automated cookware during the sessions.

## Registration and Attendance Fees

The workshop is by invitation from the organizers only. To have an
opportunity to be invited in future editions, publicly contribute to
eventually-consistent peer-to-peer systems in one or many of the following
ways: publish your insights in pre-print venues, such as
[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/), write insightful posts on your blog, and
contribute to the technical development of eventually-consistent peer-to-peer
systems.

We ask for 60 CHF/EUR for attendance, regardless of when you arrive or leave,
to cover meal costs including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

### Sponsoring

If you have an **academic** affiliation and will give a talk, the Computer Networks Group can access university funds to help cover travel and accommodation. Contact [Christian Tschudin](mailto:christian.tschudin@unibas.ch).
