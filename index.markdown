## **REGISTRATION CLOSED FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. SPOTS STILL AVAILABLE SUNDAY AND MONDAY. SEE [BELOW](#attendance-fees-and-registration).** 

[Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)](https://scuttlebutt.nz/) is an application-level, secure and persisted publish/subscribe system that has gained popularity in the decentralized Web movement. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers, software builders and members of the SSB community to study the properties and potential of Secure Scuttlebutt. The workshop is open to other decentralized approaches and networking technologies e.g. DAT, Holochain, IPFS or SOLID, as problems and technologies often have considerable similarities. Also, a SSB tutorial precedes the workshop, helping people to get familiar with the Secure Scuttlebutt technology and value system in short time. ~~Limited travel and accommodation grants are available to help facilitate attendance from people without institutional funding~~ We've received several applications, this grant opportunity is now closed. A **huge thank you** to SSBC and Planetary for providing financial support ðŸ’—

## Venue

Venue for the event is the [Departement of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/) of the [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en.html), located at [Spiegelgasse 1](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5228942689). Talks and discussions will happen in the conference room on the 6th floor. Food and refreshments will be available in the adjacent cafeteria.

### -> Newcomers Intro to Secure-Scuttlebutt (Friday January 27th Morning)

You do not need to be familiar with Secure-Scuttlebutt to join! An introduction session will be hosted for newcomers to learn about the fundamentals, prior to the rest of the event. You can already get acquainted with [related material](#references).

### -> Kuukkeli Hacklab Remote Presentation (Friday January 27th Afternoon)

Starting at 13h CET, Sami will remotely present *Atacama: retrocomputing-proof distributed twitter-like* from a hacker space/lounge in Finland. The featured presentation will last 20 min. + 10 min. for questions. Notwithstanding technical or logistical issues, we will try keeping the connection open afterwards for remote interaction. 

The rest of the afternoon is open to participant-driven sessions.

### -> Invited Talks (Saturday January 28th and Sunday January 29th Mornings)

Saturday and Sunday mornings will have 20-minutes talks, each followed by a question period of 10 minutes. There are 5 slots reserved on each day. These slots are intended for more structured presentations prepared in advance of the event. This is especially relevant if you want to present prior published academic work, progress reports on ongoing projects, or any other topic you have spent significant time reflecting upon. Please contact [Erick Lavoie](#contacts) to discuss your talk proposal.

### -> Basel Tour (Saturday January 28th evening)

Luc Heitz, one of the participants and student at University of Basel, kindly offered to guide a tour of Basel around the Department and present some historical landmarks and facts.

Attendance is optional and the session may run concurrently with other participant-organized sessions.

### -> [Paper Museum](https://www.baslerpapiermuehle.ch/museum/?lang=en) (Sunday January 29th Afternoon)

We have reserved a 2h guided tour of the Paper Museum, which also includes hands-on papermaking and printing. Let us know if you are interested, the number of spots is limited!

## Travel and Accommodations

You will have to organize travel and accommodations yourself. Basel is easily accessible by train and by plane. To share accommodation costs, you can synchronize with [other participants](#volunteering-and-self-organization). 

## Volunteering and Self-Organization

Most of the program will be done in a participant-driven [unconference style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). You can already think about sessions you'd like to host, discussions you'd like to initiate, etc. And if you feel like it, why not prepare a lightning talk?

Also, we'd love to see people take responsibility for some part of the event: perhaps you'd like to coordinate the preparation of a meal, host the lightning talks, know a way of gently raising people's energy on Monday morning, or see another opportunity that is currently missing in the schedule? Then please [reach out to us](#contacts) and we'll make sure you can have your fun =). Any suggestions for vegan recipes are greatly appreciated.

You can also already discuss with other participants via:

- Signal Group (moderated): [https://signal.group/#CjQKILGN1m5zGIFqVW-4xJPIO5wgy655tDZQRREDmgKQEBzoEhBHVsTruzyJvNxOrIUrTM8u](https://signal.group/#CjQKILGN1m5zGIFqVW-4xJPIO5wgy655tDZQRREDmgKQEBzoEhBHVsTruzyJvNxOrIUrTM8u)
