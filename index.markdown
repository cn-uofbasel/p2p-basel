The aim of the P2P Basel workshop is to bring together researchers and software builders to share insights and collaborate towards the sound and sustainable development of efficient eventually-consistent (offline-first) peer-to-peer systems. Examples of related projects of interest are [Secure-Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/), [DAT/Hypercore](https://docs.holepunch.to/), [Cabal](https://cabal.chat/), [Earthstar](https://earthstar-project.org/), [Willow](https://willowprotocol.org/), [Nostr](https://nostr.com/), [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/), [P2Panda](https://p2panda.org/), [GNUnet](https://www.gnunet.org/), [NextGraph](https://nextgraph.org/), [Qaul](https://www.qaul.net/), [Pijul](https://pijul.org/), [Iroh](https://www.iroh.computer/). 

The workshop is intended for 16 participants, 4 from the [Computer Networks Group @ Unibasel](https://cn.dmi.unibas.ch/) and 12 invited external researchers and developers. The workshop is intentionally kept small to encourage deep technical discussions, foster strong collaborations between participants, and make the logistics easier to manage collaboratively. 

We are already at full capacity.

*TBD: To Be Decided by participants ([unconference style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference))

### -> Thursday Evening

For those arriving early, you may look at our [recommended places](./recommendations.html) for eating and socializing.

### -> Official Welcome (Friday January 23rd 9h-10h)

The official opening of the workshop will be done on Friday morning with a
brief announcement from Erick, a roundtable to get to know each other, 
and planning for sharing cooking and cleaning chores.

### -> Tutorials/Lectures (Friday January 23rd Morning & Afternoon)

Tutorials/lectures provide a presentation of fundamental concepts and skills
that may help participants better understand the following talks and
discussions. We have time for 5 introduction tutorials and lectures of 45-50
minutes on core topics of interest. Already planned lectures are:

  1. (Fri. ??) ?? by [Ali Ajorian](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/ajorian-ali/)  
  2. (Fri. ??) ?? by [Osman Bicer](https://cn.dmi.unibas.ch/en/people/dr-osman-bicer/)   
  3. (Fri. ??) ?? by [Christian Tschudin](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/christian-tschudin/) 
  4. (Fri. ??) ?? by [Erick Lavoie](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/lavoie-erick)   
  5. (Fri. ??) ?? by ?? 

These lectures are open to students and researchers of the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Basel. Participants are
invited to prepare in advance by reading the relevant reference material.

### -> Student Project Presentations (Friday January 23rd Morning & Afternoon)

Some of the students having successfully completed a related Bachelor or Master
project/thesis in the Computer Networks Group will present their work, in 25
minutes. The following presentations have already been planned:

  1. (Fri. ??) "Late-Binding between Groups and Permissions based on Trust in Offline-First System" by Paul Tröger  
  2. (Fri. ??) "Gachix: A binary cache for Nix over Git" by Ephraim Siegfried [[pdf]](https://cn.dmi.unibas.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/redesign-cn-dmi/pubs/theses/bachelor/Siegfried-Gachix-Nix-Bin-Cache-Over-Git.pdf) [[source code]](https://github.com/EphraimSiegfried/gachix)
  3. (Fri. ??) "P2P e-voting Protocol" by Martin Chikov
 
These presentations are open to students and researchers of the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Basel. Participants are
invited to prepare in advance by reading the referenced reports.

### -> Mature Insights Talks (Saturday January 24th and Sunday January 25th Mornings)

**Format**: 15-20 minutes of prepared content but with a generous time
allowance of up to 20 minutes for interactive questions and discussions with
other participants.

**Purpose**: The talks should present new insights that are likely to
be useful to other participants in their own projects. These insights might
come, for example, from having deeply reflected about fundamental problems, or
found unexpected issues in deployments that you wished you had known earlier
because they would have led to different design decisions. You are strongly
encouraged, but not obliged, to publish those insights in citable academic
papers (such as pre-prints on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/)) or blog posts on
your project's website prior to your talk. If you do so, we will link to them
next to your talk. 

The talks are not intended for general marketing of your project: all
participants are already fully busy advancing their own project(s) and so they
are unlikely to drop theirs to join yours. Marketing towards a general audience
will be better served by other venues (blog posts, videos, talks in larger
conferences, etc.).

Planned talks so far:
  1. ??

### -> Early Seeds Talks (Saturday January 24th Late Morning)

**Format**: 5-10 minutes of prepared content with no question.

**Purpose**: Early seeds talks should aim to provide an interesting perspective
or insights that have not been validated already, to stimulate interesting
discussions and draw attention to potential topics for the unconference part.

Planned talks so far:
  1. ??


## Travel and Accommodations

You will have to organize travel and accommodations yourself. Basel is easily
accessible by train and by plane. The cheapest hosting option is typically
AirBnB.

## Volunteering and Self-Organization

Half of the program will be done in a participant-driven [unconference
style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). You can already think about
sessions you'd like to host, discussions you'd like to initiate, etc.

To keep registration fees low, we will collectively cook and clean for
ourselves during the event. All participants are expected to contribute: aprons
and kitchenware are provided. Meals will be organized so that they do not
require more than 30-60 minutes of preparation/cleaning from volunteers during
the meal breaks, and will cook (if needed) in automated cookware during the
sessions.

## Registration and Attendance Fees

The workshop is by invitation from the organizers only. To have an
opportunity to be invited in future editions, publicly contribute to
eventually-consistent peer-to-peer systems in one or many of the following
ways: publish your insights in pre-print venues, such as
[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/), write insightful posts on your blog, and
contribute to the technical development of eventually-consistent peer-to-peer
systems.

We ask for 75 CHF / 80 EUR for attendance, regardless of when
you arrive or leave, to cover meal costs including breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.   

### Sponsoring

If you have an **academic** affiliation and will give a talk, the Computer
Networks Group can access university funds to help cover travel and
accommodation. Contact [Christian
Tschudin](mailto:christian.tschudin@unibas.ch).
