# P2P Basel 2023

From Friday the 27.01.2020 to Monday the 30.02.2020, we will gather with ssb folks and Swiss academics and students in Basel for three days of discussion on scuttlebutt and its underlying principles. While there will be some structured program blocks, the main focus lies on participant-driven sessions. Quoting the announcement blob that we will use to ~~lure in~~ invite external academics:

> Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) is an application-level secure, persisted publish/subscribe system that has gained popularity in the decentralized Web movement. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers, software builders and members of the SSB community to study the properties and potential of Secure Scuttlebutt. The workshop is open to other decentralized approaches and networking technolgies e.g. DAT, Holochain, IPFS or SOLID, as problems and technologies often have considerable similarities. Also, a SSB tutorial preceds the workshop, helping people to get familiar with the Secure Scuttlebutt technology and value system in short time. A travel and accommodation grant has been put in place to help facilitate attendance from people without institutional funding.

## Venue

Venue for the event is the [Spiegelgasse 1 in Basel](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5228942689), in the Departement Mathematik und Informatik of University of Basel. 

## Schedule

## Registration and Fees

TBA


Additionally, if you have an **academic** affiliation and can give a short presentation on some ssb-related topic, we can access university funds to pay for your travel expenses.

## Volunteering

The program will be done in a participant-driven [unconference style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). You can already think about sessions you'd like to host, discussions you'd like to initiate, etc. And if you feel like it, why not prepare a lightning talk?

Also, we'd love to see people take responsibility for some part of the event: perhaps you'd like to coordinate the preparation of a meal, host the lightning talks, know a way of gently raising people's energy on Sunday morning, or see another opportunity that is currently missing in the (still preliminary) schedule? Then please reach out to us and we'll make sure you can have your fun =). And finally, any suggestions for vegan recipes are greatly appreciated.
